<h2>How Did This Get Made? Episode #67</h2>
<p>July 16, 2013</p>
       <p>ATTENTION: There was a film that came on Syfy channel that was so important that we had to disrupt our regularly scheduled programming in order to present to you a very special episode of How Did This Get Made? about Sharknado. Most Valuable Podcaster, Scott Aukerman returns to help us figure out the importance of the ship captain opening scene, if a sharknado is scientifically possible, how Tara Reid become a part of this, and where the government was throughout the movie. Plus, June delivers an amazing performance of Novaâ€™s monologue about the origin of her scar. Chomp. Chomp. Chomp. </p>
